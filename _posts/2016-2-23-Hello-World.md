title: COPY ME - The Existential being of non-life
---



**Copy Me is an Bio-Technical, existential exploration of myself 
and the future of non-living organisms.**

Without a breath you cannot survive. The breath is an indicator of your wellbeing, it’s necessary for your survival and it can tell us a lot about your state of being. I will create a non-living organism that resembles my life and copy’s my own existing in a minimalistic manner. As this non-living organism comes out of me I divided it’s story into 5 parts starting with my own life.


**I divided my project into 5 stages including my creative proces**

1. Discovery of sexuality
2. Searching for the right mate(s)
3. Pregnancy
4. Birth
5. Non-life


**Stage 1: Discovery of sexuality**
Without the ultimate need to start creating autonomous work to express my existential need for creativity, Copy Me wouldn’t have existed. The discovery of sexuality is the part of the story where I search for myself in the light of the autonomous artist/designer. How will I express myself as a creative human and what will this mean for my life and the projects I create. What is the ultimate project to start my journey and which skills do I need to have to complete a project successfully. 
etc


**Stage 2: Searching for the right mate(s)**
 knew I wanted to give a part of myself to the project, so I decided to do it literally. The idea to copy my breath into a non-living organism was formed and so it was time to start searching for the right way to do this. I knew I didn’t possess the skills to create something at the level I was looking for. I had to test a lot of different things to know what I liked, why i liked it, and why it would support my creativity.
 
Conceptual Advancements
Technological Advancements
Biological Advancements


**Stage 3: Pregnancy**

Recording my breathing patterns
For 9 months I will track my breath, track my surroundings and track my agenda. All these things are in relation to each other and will be documented. The focus lies on the breath and all the things that surround and influence it. 

WGrowing the Biological Parts for the Non-Living organism
During these 9 months I will grow the organic parts of the non-living organism. The parts will be 

Creating the digital Parts for the Non-Living organism
Within these 9 months I will create the technical parts of the organism, 

For 9 Months I will create an artificial pregnancy where I track my breath and my surrounding.


**Stage 4: Birth**
In a few days, the non-living organism will be assembled and put to non-life. 


**Stage 5: Non-life**
Copy Me will exist in an autonomous manner



**Next steps**
Finding different 
methods for making the
skin / Insides of COPY ME


IDEAL GOAL:
Being able to grow a skin that
is stretchable and can grow within 
9 months
